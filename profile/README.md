🚀 **Public release:** September 15, 2025  
🌐 Website: [sym8.io](https://sym8.io)

## 🌀 What is Sym8?

Sym8 is a modern fork and continuation of the open-source CMS Symphony, originally created by Alistair Kearney and the Symphony community. It preserves the power of XSLT and the elegance of modular extensibility – brought up to date for modern PHP and developer workflows.

## 🔥 What's new?

### HTML5 inside

All standard HTML5 input types – including `color`, `email`, `month`, `number`, `range`, `tel`, `time`, `url` and `week` – are now natively supported in the Symphony Core. This enables native browser validation and improves accessibility and usability out of the box.

### Features

Sym8 ships with essential improvements and must-have extensions out of the box:

- 🌐 Database connection changed from __utf8__ to __utf8mb4__ (multibyte)
- ✅ __Dashboard__-Extension (required) — shows system environment (PHP version, available pages, data sources, sections) and includes a feed for upcoming Sym8 versions
- 🗜 __HTML5__-Extension: the trailing slash for self-closing elements is removed according to the recommendation of the W3C validator. Addional the HTML source code can be minified.
- ✨ Minimalist frontend with [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/) included for a clean start
